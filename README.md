# Swift Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift. The `calculateArea` function is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.  However, incorrect usage with mismatched types leads to a compile-time error.

The `bug.swift` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.swift` file demonstrates the correct way to avoid this issue by ensuring that input parameters are the correct type.
